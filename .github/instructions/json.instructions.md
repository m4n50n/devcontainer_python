# JSON Guidelines

- Use **2 spaces** for indentation.
- Do **not** include trailing commas.
- Keep keys in **camelCase** unless a schema dictates otherwise.
- Preserve ordering and structure; avoid reformatting unrelated parts.
- Validate against an existing schema when available.
- Ensure files end with a newline.
